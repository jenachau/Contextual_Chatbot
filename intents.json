                    "Characterized:.\n A whitehead is a type of acne that forms when dead skin cells, oil, and bacteria become trapped within one of your pores. Whiteheads can be annoying, and they may seem to develop at the worst times.\nCause:.\n - Whiteheads occur when skin pores clog with oil, dead skin, and debris.\n- Hormonal changes. During puberty, androgen hormone levels rise, which increases oil production and stimulates new skin cell turnover.\n - Changing hormone levels can also contribute to breakouts during menstruation, pregnancy and menopause.\nTreatment:.\n - Non-inflammatory acne, including whiteheads, may respond to over-the-counter (OTC) treatments.\n - For mild breakouts, benzoyl peroxide and salicylic acid products can be effective.\n - In some cases, doctors recommend extruding or extracting whiteheads when medication fails to get rid of them."
